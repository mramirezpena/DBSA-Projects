These are the .ipynb files for the graded projects I completed for my Post-Gradute Program in Data Science & Business Analytics.
There were 7 main modules; for Project 6, I opted to do a PPT presentation, so there will be no file for it.
Projects 3 through 6 focused on supervised learning, while project 7 focused on unsupervised learning.
Each project contains an overview and task description at the beginning.


PROJECT 1 covered basic data science libraries NumPy and Pandas, as well as foundational Python skills.

PROJECT 2 covered hypothesis testing and statistical inference.

PROJECT 3 covered linear regression.

PROJECT 4 covered logistic regression and decision trees.

PROJECT 5 covered ensemble techniques using classification algorithms.

PROJECT 6 (no file) covered over/undersampling and regularization.

PROJECT 7 covered K-Means and hierarchical clustering techniques.
